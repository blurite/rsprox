/**
 * Message clan channel is used to send messages within a clan channel
 * that the player is in.
 * @property clanType the type of the clan the player is in
 * @property name the name of the player sending the message
 * @property worldId the id of the world from which the message is sent
 * @property worldMessageCounter the world-local message counter.
 * Each world must have its own message counter which is used to create
 * a unique id for each message. This message counter must be
 * incrementing with each message that is sent out.
 * If two messages share the same unique id (which is a combination of
 * the [worldId] and the [worldMessageCounter] properties),
 * the client will not render the second message if it already has one
 * received in the last 100 messages.
 * It is additionally worth noting that servers with low population
 * should probably not start the counter at the same value with each
 * game boot, as the probability of multiple messages coinciding
 * is relatively high in that scenario, given the low quantity of
 * messages sent out to begin with.
 * Additionally, only the first 24 bits of the counter are utilized,
 * meaning a value from 0 to 16,777,215 (inclusive).
 * A good starting point for message counting would be to take the
 * hour of the year and multiply it by 50,000 when the server boots
 * up. This means the roll-over happens roughly after every two weeks.
 * Fine-tuning may be used to make it more granular, but the overall
 * idea remains the same.
 * @property chatCrownType the chat crown type to be rendered next to the name
 * @property message the message to send
