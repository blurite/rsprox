/**
 * Loc anim specific packets are used to make a loc play an animation,
 * specific to one player and not the entire world.
 * @property id the id of the animation to play
 * @property zoneX the x coordinate of the zone's south-western corner in the
 * build area.
 * @property xInZone the x coordinate of the loc within the zone it is in,
 * a value in range of 0 to 7 (inclusive) is expected. Any bits outside that are ignored.
 * @property zoneZ the z coordinate of the zone's south-western corner in the
 * build area.
 * @property zInZone the z coordinate of the loc within the zone it is in,
 * a value in range of 0 to 7 (inclusive) is expected. Any bits outside that are ignored.
 * @property shape the shape of the loc, a value of 0 to 22 (inclusive) is expected.
 * @property rotation the rotation of the loc, a value of 0 to 3 (inclusive) is expected.
 *
 * It should be noted that the [zoneX] and [zoneZ] coordinates are relative
 * to the build area in their absolute form, not in their shifted zone form.
 * If the player is at an absolute coordinate of 50, 40 within the build area(104x104),
 * the expected coordinates to transmit here would be 48, 40, as that would
 * point to the south-western corner of the zone in which the player is standing in.
 * The client will add up the respective [zoneX] + [xInZone] properties together,
 * along with [zoneZ] + [zInZone] to re-create the effects of a normal zone packet.
