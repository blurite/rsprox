/**
 * Cam rotateby is used to rotate the camera towards another angle.
 * One way to think of this packet is that it **adds** values to the
 * x and y angles of the camera.
 *
 * @property xAngle the additional angle to add to the x-axis of the camera.
 * It's worth noting that the x angle of the camera ranges between 128 and
 * 383 (inclusive), and the resulting value is coerced in that range.
 * Negative values are also accepted.
 * Additionally, there is currently a bug in the client that causes the
 * third and the fifth least significant bits of the resulting angle to
 * be discarded due to the code doing (cameraXAngle + [xAngle] & 2027),
 * which is further coerced into the 128-383 range.
 * @property yAngle the additional angle to add to the y-axis of the camera.
 * Unlike the x-axis angle, this one ranges from 0 to 2047 (inclusive),
 * and does not get coerced - instead it will just roll over (e.g. 2047 -> 0).
 * @property duration the duration of the movement in client cycles (20ms/cc)
 * @property function the camera easing function, allowing for finer
 * control over the way it moves from the start coordinate to the end.
