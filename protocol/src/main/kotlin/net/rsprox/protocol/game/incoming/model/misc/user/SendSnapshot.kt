 * ```
 *
 * @property name the name of the player that is being reported
 * @property ruleId the rule that the player broke (see table above).
 * Note that the rule ids are internal and not what one sees on the interface,
 * as the rule ids must be persistent across years of usage. Additionally,
 * the "Boxing in Deadman Tournament" and "Muling in the Deadman Tournament"
 * rules can only be selected if the player is logged into a Deadman world.
 * Additionally worth noting that the rule ids are 1 less than what is shown
 * in clientscripts, as the clientscript command behind sending the snapshot
 * decrements 1 from the value prior to submitting it to the server.
 * @property mute whether to mute the player. This option is only possible
 * by Player and Jagex moderators.
