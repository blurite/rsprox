/**
 * Update zone full-follows packets are used to clear a zone (8x8x1 tiles space)
 * from any modifications done to it prior, wiping any obj and loc changes in
 * the process. This packet additionally sets the 'current zone pointer' to this
 * zone, allowing one to follow it with any other zone payload packet, commonly
 * used to synchronize the zone to the observer (restoring all the objs in it,
 * loc changes and so on).
 * @property zoneX the x coordinate of the zone's south-western corner in the
 * build area.
 * @property zoneZ the z coordinate of the zone's south-western corner in the
 * build area.
 * @property level the height level of the zone, typically equal to the player's
 * own height level.
 *
 * It should be noted that the [zoneX] and [zoneZ] coordinates are relative
 * to the build area in their absolute form, not in their shifted zone form.
 * If the player is at an absolute coordinate of 50, 40 within the build area(104x104),
 * the expected coordinates to transmit here would be 48, 40, as that would
 * point to the south-western corner of the zone in which the player is standing in.
