/**
 * Mouse move messages are sent when the user moves their mouse across
 * the client, in this case, on the enhanced C++ clients.
 * @property totalTime the total time in milliseconds that all the movements
 * inside this event span across
 * @property averageTime the average time in milliseconds between each movement.
 * The average time is truncated according to integer division rules in the JVM.
 * This is equal to `totalTime / count`.
 * @property remainingTime the remaining time from the [averageTime] integer
 * division. This is equal to `totalTime % count`.
 * @property movements all the recorded mouse movements within this message.
 * Mouse movements are recorded by the client at a 50 millisecond interval,
 * meaning any movements within that 50 milliseconds are discarded, and
 * only the position changes of the mouse at each 50 millisecond interval
 * are sent.
