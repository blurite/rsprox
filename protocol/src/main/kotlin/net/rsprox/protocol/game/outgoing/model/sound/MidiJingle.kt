/**
 * Midi jingle packet is used to play a short midi song, typically when
 * the player accomplishes something. The normal song that was playing
 * will be resumed after the jingle finishes playing.
 * In the old days, the [lengthInMillis] property was used to tell the client
 * how long the jingle lasts, so it knows when to resume the normal midi song.
 * It has long since been removed, however - while the client expects a 24-bit
 * integer for the length, it does not use this value in any way.
 * @property id the id of the jingle to play
 * @property lengthInMillis the length in milliseconds of the jingle, now unused.
