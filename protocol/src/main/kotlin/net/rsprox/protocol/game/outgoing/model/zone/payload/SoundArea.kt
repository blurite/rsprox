/**
 * Sound area packed is sent to play a sound effect at a specific coord.
 * Any players within [radius] tiles of the destination coord will
 * hear this sound effect played, if they have sound effects enabled.
 * The volume will change according to the player's distance to the
 * origin coord of the sound effect itself.
 * It is worth noting there is a maximum quantity of 50 area sound effects
 * that can play concurrently in the client across all the zones.
 * Therefore, a potential optimization one can do is prevent appending
 * any more area sound effects once the quantity has reached 50 in a zone.
 * @property id the id of the sound effect to play
 * @property delay the delay in client cycles (20ms/cc) until the
 * sound effect starts playing
 * @property loops how many loops the sound effect should do.
 * If the [loops] property is 0, the sound effect will not play.
 * @property radius the radius from the originating coord how far the sound
 * effect can be heard. Note that the client ignores the 4 higher bits of
 * this value, meaning the maximum radius is 31 tiles - anything above has
 * no effect.
 * @property size the size of the origin. In most cases, this should be
 * a value of 1. However, if a larger value is provided, it means the
 * client will treat the south-western coord provided here as the
 * south-western corner of the 'box' that is made with this size in mind,
 * for the purpose of having an evenly-spreading volume around this
 * element.
 * This size property is primarily used for larger NPCs, to make their
 * sound effects flow out smoothly from all sides.
 * @property xInZone the x coordinate of the sound effect within the zone it is in,
 * a value in range of 0 to 7 (inclusive) is expected. Any bits outside that are ignored.
 * @property zInZone the z coordinate of the sound effect within the zone it is in,
 * a value in range of 0 to 7 (inclusive) is expected. Any bits outside that are ignored.
